# Odin Recipes

This project is a simple recipe website created as part of the Odin Project curriculum. It currently features recipes for Homemade Chicken Nuggets, World's Best Lasagna, and Brigadeiro.

## Introduction

The Odin Recipes project aims to practice basic HTML knowledge.

## Skills Demonstrated

Upon completing this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

1. **HTML Fundamentals**: Creating semantic HTML structure for web pages.
2. **Git Version Control**: Using Git for project management, including committing changes with descriptive messages was the most important part of this project, in my opinion.
3. **Project Organization**: Structuring files and directories for a simple web project.
4. **Documentation**: Writing a README.md file to provide an overview of the project and its goals.

This project serves as a foundation for further exploration in web development and version control practices. Through iterative development and continuous learning, I aim to improve my skills and build more complex projects in the future.
