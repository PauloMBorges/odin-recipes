# Odin Recipes

This project is a simple recipe website that aims to practice basic HTML knowledge and CSS Styling created as part of the Odin Project curriculum. It currently features recipes for Homemade Chicken Nuggets, World's Best Lasagna, and Brigadeiro.

This project serves as a foundation for further exploration in web development and version control practices. Through continuous learning, I look forward to improve my skills and build more complex projects in the future.
